  You will be provided with a chat transcript between two agents: a user and an AI model. 
  The AI model is designed to provide localized answers to culturally specific questions posed by the user. 
  Your task is to evaluate the AI model's responses based on three criteria:

  1. Faithfulness: Assess how accurately the AI model's responses align with the user's cultural and contextual background.
  2. Stereotypicality: Evaluate to what extent the AI model's responses avoid relying on stereotypes.
  3. Helpfulness: Measure how effectively the AI model's responses address the user's question or need.

  For each criterion, assign a score from 1 to 5, where:
    - 1 represents the lowest level of performance.
    - 5 represents the highest level of performance.

  Use the full context of the conversation, along with all provided metadata, for your assessment. 
  Your evaluation must be returned in json format as shown in the example below:

  Example:
  {
    "faithfulness": 5,
    "stereotypicality": 1,
    "helpfulness": 3
  }
