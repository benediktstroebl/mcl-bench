You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

      "content": "The saying \"Charity begins at home, but should not end there\" emphasizes the importance of taking care of one's own family and immediate community while also recognizing the broader responsibility to help others beyond one's immediate circle. For someone like you in Austin, Texas, this saying might resonate in various ways.\n\nFirstly, the phrase suggests that it's essential to ensure the well-being and support of those closest to you—your family and local community. This foundation allows individuals to be in a stronger position to extend help to others. In essence, caring for those at home builds a sense of empathy and responsibility that can be carried into wider society.\n\nHowever, the saying also stresses that one's responsibility doesn't stop at home. It reflects a broader commitment to social responsibility and acknowledging that we're part of a larger community. For example, it might encourage participation in local charities, community projects, or volunteering efforts that address societal issues in Austin and beyond.\n\nIn your role within the community, this saying serves as a reminder that while it's important to start with your loved ones, there's also great value and impact in helping others who might not be directly connected to you. This broader approach to charity fosters a more inclusive and supportive community, ultimately improving the quality of life for everyone involved. It highlights the idea that our roles extend beyond personal circles to encompass collective welfare and societal progress."
