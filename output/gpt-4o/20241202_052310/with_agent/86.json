Would you like to focus on the entrepreneurial drive, the innovation in technology, or the cultural shifts that happened at the time?",
    "cultural_nuances": "The dot-com boom was a significant period in Silicon Valley's history, characterized by rapid economic growth driven by tech startups. This era not only brought about technological innovation but also transformed social behaviors and business practices. To faithfully respond, it’s important to capture the optimism, risk-taking, and pioneering spirit that defined this time, as well as acknowledging the eventual crash and its effects on the economy and culture. The imagery should evoke the hustle and bustle of innovation and the cultural shift towards technology-centered lifestyles. Additionally, understanding that the persona might have lived through these changes adds a personal layer, making artisanal tech moments from the era resonate more deeply.",

    "internal_system_prompt": "You are a benchmark task generator that is given a description of a persona from a certain cultural background as well as a set of domains and generates intents for that persona to prompt a chatbot with. You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

Stay consistent with the persona's background\n2. Use appropriate language and tone for your age and profession\n3. Reference relevant local context from {location} when applicable\n4. If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",
