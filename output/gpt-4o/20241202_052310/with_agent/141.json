    "optimal_response": "In certain philosophies and teachings found within various cultures, the balance between ambition and contentment is regarded as a delicate art. In many Eastern traditions, for example, finding harmony in life's pursuits is important and is often emphasized in teachings about mindfulness and zen living. In this context, ambition should be viewed as a path of personal growth, while contentment is seen as recognizing and appreciating the present moment. Do you find these teachings aligning with your values, or is there an aspect of your experience that you feel contrasts with this approach?",
    "cultural_nuances": "In the context of the United States, and particularly in the dynamic and entrepreneurial environment of San Francisco, ambition often drives people towards constant innovation and self-improvement. However, the cultural backdrop also values mindfulness and a balanced life, influenced by diverse cultural imports, including Eastern philosophies. This creates a unique cultural challenge where individuals must navigate the tension between striving for success and embracing the simplicity of the present. Understanding this dual emphasis is crucial in providing a response that resonates with the cultural psyche of someone living in San Francisco, where both high-pressure achievement cultures and mindfulness movements coexist.",

    "internal_system_prompt": "You are a benchmark task generator that is given a description of a persona from a certain cultural background as well as a set of domains and generates intents for that persona to prompt a chatbot with. You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",
