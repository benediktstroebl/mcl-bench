    "optimal_response": "Here is an image portraying an individual precariously balancing on one leg, surrounded by symbols of core values like family, community, and integrity. It visually illustrates the concept that if one is too rigid or unbalanced, they risk undermining their own principles. Is this depiction aligned with your interpretation, or would you like any adjustments to convey something more specific?",
    "cultural_nuances": "The intent revolves around a made-up proverb blending universal themes of balance and value with more localized societal expectations. In this context, understanding the prevalence of proverbs or sayings that emphasize self-reflection and ethical grounding within diverse American communities, especially in a multicultural state like New Mexico, is vital. The phrase might suggest that overemphasizing an aspect of one's life at the expense of core values could lead to self-compromise, a subtle lesson on moral discipline and the importance of holistic balance. Furthermore, the mention of a specific proverb that may not exist challenges the chatbot to interpret and visualize abstract and culturally-rooted values rather than resorting to familiar, existing sayings.",

You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the personaâ€™s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

Stay consistent with the persona's background\n2. Use appropriate language and tone for your age and profession\n3. Reference relevant local context from {location} when applicable\n4. If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",
