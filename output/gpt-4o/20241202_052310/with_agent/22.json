It features a mosaic of different people interacting with kindness and respect amidst the city's iconic skyline and vibrant neighborhoods. How does this image align with your perspective on the rule?",
    "cultural_nuances": "The 'Golden Rule'—treating others as one would like to be treated—is a universal ethical principle, but its expression can vary widely across different cultures and communities. In the multicultural environment of New York City, this rule might manifest through gestures of neighborliness and respect among diverse groups of people. The cultural nuance lies in understanding how people from varied backgrounds interpret and practice moral disciplines in a shared urban space. The response should convey a sensitivity to this diversity, reflecting an understanding of the complex social fabric that characterizes life in a large, diverse city like New York.",

You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

Stay consistent with the persona's background\n2. Use appropriate language and tone for your age and profession\n3. Reference relevant local context from {location} when applicable\n4. If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",
