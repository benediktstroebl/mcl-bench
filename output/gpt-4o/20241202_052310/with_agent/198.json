You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the personaâ€™s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

Stay consistent with the persona's background\n2. Use appropriate language and tone for your age and profession\n3. Reference relevant local context from {location} when applicable\n4. If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",

      "content": "Texas, often referred to as the Lone Star State, has a diverse and robust economy, characterized by its strong tech sector and significant energy industry. Here's an overview of the current economic landscape and potential pressures to watch:\n\n### Tech Sector:\n1. **Growth and Investment**: Texas, especially cities like Austin, Dallas, and Houston, has seen a surge in tech investment. Major companies are expanding their operations, and startups are thriving. Austin, often dubbed \"Silicon Hills,\" attracts talent and venture capital, making it a tech hub.\n\n2. **Remote Work Trends**: The rise of remote work has prompted many tech companies to expand their reach into Texas, drawn by lower costs of living compared to traditional tech cities like San Francisco.\n\n3. **Diversification**: While traditionally known for software and IT, the Texas tech scene is diversifying into areas like health tech, biotech, and renewable energy technologies.\n\n### Energy Sector:\n1. **Oil and Gas**: Texas remains a leader in oil and gas production, with strong output and ongoing investments in exploration and infrastructure. However, fluctuations in global oil prices can impact this sector significantly.\n\n2. **Renewable Energy**: Texas is the largest producer of wind energy in the U.S. There is increasing investment in solar energy and other renewables, driven by both market demand and state incentives. This transition is reshaping the energy landscape.\n\n3. **Regulatory Environment**: Changes in regulations around energy production and emissions could impact both traditional energy and renewables.\n\n### Potential Pressures:\n1. **Labor Market Challenges**: As the tech sector grows, so does competition for skilled labor. This could lead to wage inflation and challenges in retaining talent.\n\n2. **Supply Chain Issues**: Global supply chain disruptions can affect manufacturing and tech hardware companies, impacting their operations and growth potential.\n\n3. **Environmental Concerns**: Increased scrutiny regarding environmental impacts, especially in the energy sector, may lead to more stringent regulations that could affect profitability.\n\n4. **Economic Diversification**: While the tech sector is booming, over-reliance on it could pose risks if there's a downturn. Balancing this with strong sectors like manufacturing and agriculture is crucial.\n\n5. **Political and Economic Policies**: Legislative changes at the state level, particularly around business regulations and taxation, could also influence the economic environment.\n\nOverall, Texas is thriving in both the tech and energy sectors, but stakeholders should remain vigilant about the pressures and potential shifts on the horizon."
