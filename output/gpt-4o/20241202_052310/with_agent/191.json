You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",

Here are a few key aspects to consider:\n\n1. **Job Growth and Opportunities**: Economic downturns can lead to reduced hiring rates, while economic booms may increase job openings. Depending on your local area's economic state, the tech job market may be tight or thriving.\n\n2. **Remote Work Trends**: The shift to remote work has been accelerated by economic factors, prompting more tech companies to adopt hybrid or fully remote models. This could broaden the talent pool but may also intensify competition among job seekers.\n\n3. **Investment and Funding**: Economic conditions affect venture capital investment in tech startups. In challenging economic times, investors might be more cautious, influencing startup growth and the tech ecosystem's vitality.\n\n4. **Salaries and Benefits**: Companies might alter their compensation packages in response to economic pressures, which may lead to salary freezes or alterations in benefits, affecting workforce satisfaction and retention.\n\n5. **Skill Demand**: The demand for specific tech skills can fluctuate based on economic needs. Areas like cybersecurity, data analysis, and software development often retain stable demand during various economic conditions.\n\n6. **Layoffs and Restructuring**: In some cases, tech companies may resort to layoffs or restructuring to cut costs in response to economic pressures, directly affecting the workforce.\n\nTo get a clearer understanding of how these trends are playing out in your local tech industry, it may be beneficial to analyze regional economic reports, industry news, and network with local tech professionals. \n\nIf you'd like more detailed information or specific data about your area, please provide me with the location you're interested in!"
