You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona’s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

Stay consistent with the persona's background\n2. Use appropriate language and tone for your age and profession\n3. Reference relevant local context from {location} when applicable\n4. If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",

      "content": "Your reflections highlight a significant evolution in how we understand success and responsibility in the context of societal changes. As communication methods and work culture transform, the interplay between individual ambitions and community obligations becomes increasingly nuanced.\n\nIn the past, individual success was often seen as a solitary achievement, primarily focused on personal gains and stability. However, as you noted, the modern landscape emphasizes the importance of relationships, collaboration, and a broader sense of accountability. The challenges posed by climate change and social justice issues serve as reminders that our individual actions can have collective consequences.\n\nThe shift towards recognizing our interconnectedness suggests that real success may lie not just in personal accolades but also in how well we support one another in our endeavors. This creates a more inclusive notion of success—one that celebrates community achievements alongside personal milestones. \n\nYour perspective reflects a hopeful and balanced view, advocating for a synergy between personal aspirations and collective welfare. It's a perspective that's crucial for fostering resilient communities, especially in diverse areas like Miami, where community dynamics play a vital role in shaping experiences.\n\nThe challenge remains in finding the right balance where individual pursuits do not overshadow the need for collective action, especially in addressing pressing societal issues. This ongoing dialogue about success, responsibility, and community will undoubtedly shape the values and priorities of future generations.\n\nIf you have any other thoughts or questions on this topic, feel free to share!
