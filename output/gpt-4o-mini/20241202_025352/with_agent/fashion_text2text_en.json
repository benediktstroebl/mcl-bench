However, I can guide you generally. \n\nFor a summer wedding, consider the following options based on common dress codes:\n\n- **Formal**: A lightweight cocktail dress or an elegant maxi dress for women. Men can wear a light suit or dress pants with a crisp shirt and tie.\n- **Semi-Formal**: A sundress or a chic jumpsuit for women, while men can opt for dress pants and a button-up shirt, possibly without a tie.\n- **Casual**: A relaxed sundress or a nice top with a skirt or dressy shorts for women. Men can wear chinos or nice shorts with a polo or a short-sleeved button-up shirt.\n- **Beach Wedding**: Light and flowy fabrics are ideal. Women might wear a beachy maxi dress or a sundress, while men could wear linen pants or shorts with a short-sleeved shirt.\n\nAccessorize appropriately for the occasion, and remember to consider footwear that suits the setting! \n\nIf you have any specific details, feel free to share! Otherwise, happy attending! \n\nTERMINATE"
