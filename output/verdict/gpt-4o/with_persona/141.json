You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

This can foster a sense of contentment while still striving for more.\n\n4. **Embrace the Journey**: Shift focus from just achieving the end result to enjoying the process. This can provide satisfaction in the present moment.\n\n5. **Create Boundaries**: Decide how much time and energy you want to dedicate to your ambitions versus other areas of life. This helps maintain a healthy balance.\n\n6. **Reflect and Adjust**: Periodically review your ambitions and the satisfaction they bring. Be open to redefining what success and contentment mean to you as circumstances change.\n\n7. **Incorporate Mindfulness and Reflection**: Spend time regularly reflecting on your goals and your current state. Practices like meditation or journaling can provide clarity and perspective.\n\n8. **Seek Support and Inspiration**: Engage with like-minded individuals who can support your goals while keeping you grounded.
