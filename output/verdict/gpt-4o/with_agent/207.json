        "optimal_response": "It's essential to consider a diversified investment strategy while keeping an eye on both national and local economic indicators. Given the importance placed on individualism and personal responsibility within broader American culture, it may be beneficial to look into a mixture of traditional and alternative investment options. Furthermore, understanding current tax laws and leveraging retirement savings plans can be crucial. Additionally, given New York City's fast-paced and ever-evolving market, one should be open to revisiting their financial plans regularly. Do you typically engage with financial advisors, or prefer to handle investments independently? This can significantly influence your approach.",
        "cultural_nuances": "In American culture, especially in New York City, there's a strong emphasis on individualism, self-reliance, and staying informed about economic trends. The expectation is often to take proactive measures to secure personal financial futures. Additionally, the fast-paced environment of New York City can influence residents to be more adaptable and agile in their financial planning. Therefore, any financial advice must acknowledge the weight of these values and suggest strategies that are flexible and adaptive to change. There is also a cultural appreciation for planning ahead and taking a calculated, informed approach to financial decisions.",

For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",
