        "cultural_nuances": "The spiritual culture in Northern California, especially around San Francisco, is characterized by an eclectic blend of traditional and New Age beliefs. The region is known for its open-minded approach to spirituality, often combining elements of Eastern religions, such as Buddhism, with a deep appreciation for nature, reflected in practices like forest bathing. Understanding the significance of these landscapes as places of meditation and reflection, rather than just tourism spots, is crucial. Additionally, the spiritual journey is both an individual and a community-oriented endeavor, where personal beliefs coexist with regional spiritual narratives. To address these nuances, a response should incorporate not just geographical elements, but symbols and imagery that resonate with the spiritual diversity and introspective practices of the area.",

For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

If you are asked questions you dont know the answer to, say so.\n",
