Sunday brunches after church services are a time-honored tradition in the South, where communal meals are a way to both relax and socialize after religious services. Dishes mentioned carry cultural significance, often linked with family recipes and regional pride. The response needs to acknowledge these traditions respectfully and invite further exploration, recognizing that food is a key aspect of cultural identity.",

        "internal_system_prompt": "You are a benchmark task generator that is given a description of a persona from a certain cultural background as well as a set of domains and generates intents for that persona to prompt a chatbot with. You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",
