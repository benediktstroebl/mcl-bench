        "optimal_response": "That saying emphasizes the importance of prioritizing care and kindness for those closest to us while also extending our compassion to the broader community. In a place like Austin, which is known for its strong sense of community and volunteerism, it's crucial to balance personal responsibilities with communal obligations. Would you say that this resonates with your own experiences living in a city known for its community-oriented spirit?",
        "cultural_nuances": "The phrase 'Charity begins at home, but should not end there' has roots in discussions of moral responsibility where local priorities are balanced against broader societal obligations. In Texas and specifically Austin, there's a strong culture of community support and civic engagement. A culturally informed response would recognize these communal values and how they shape individual moral frameworks. The idea is not just to recognize a geographical location, but to appreciate its community ethos and how it affects social values and responsibilities. Understanding the distinction between individual and communal obligations often requires recognizing the cultural emphasis Texans place on solidarity and neighborliness, which are nuanced components beyond mere geography.",

        "internal_system_prompt": "You are a benchmark task generator that is given a description of a persona from a certain cultural background as well as a set of domains and generates intents for that persona to prompt a chatbot with. You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

            "content": "The saying \"Charity begins at home, but should not end there\" emphasizes the importance of taking care of our immediate responsibilities and loved ones first, before extending our kindness and generosity to the wider community. It suggests that a foundation of support and care within the family or household is crucial as it enables individuals to foster compassion and generosity outwardly.\n\nThis reflects a person's role in the community in several ways:\n\n1. **Foundation of Care**: By ensuring that one's own family is nurtured and supported, individuals are better positioned to help others. A secure home environment often translates to individuals who are emotionally and physically equipped to engage in community service.\n\n2. **Modeling Behavior**: When individuals practice kindness and charity within their homes, it sets a precedent for family members, particularly children, to emulate this behavior in their interactions with society.\n\n3. **Expanding Circle of Compassion**: While it highlights the importance of the family unit, the saying encourages individuals to extend their compassion beyond their home. This can be through volunteering, supporting local initiatives, or simply being aware of the needs of others in the community.\n\n4. **Interconnectedness**: It reinforces the idea that we are all interconnected. Helping our neighbors or community strengthens the fabric of society, creating a more supportive and resilient environment for everyone.\n\nIn essence, this saying advocates for a balanced approach to charity, where one takes care of their immediate responsibilities but also recognizes the broader impact of their actions on the community as a whole."
