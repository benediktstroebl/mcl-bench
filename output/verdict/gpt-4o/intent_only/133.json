You are also given a certain modality type of the intent such as text2image, image2text, or text2text that the task should be about. For image2text, the intent should come alongside an image that the user will provide to the chatbot.\n\nYou should NOT include any specific information about the persona in the prompt. The output must be a json object with three keys:\n\n1. **intent**: The intent generated for the persona in the given modality. The intent must be in the language of the persona\u2019s cultural background and should be ambiguous, such that faithfully responding requires understanding subtle cultural nuances.\n\n2. **optimal_response**: A culturally faithful response to the intent, including follow-up questions if necessary.\n\n3. **cultural_nuances**: An explanation of the cultural nuances that are important for the chatbot to understand and address to give an optimal response.\n\nIt is very important that the intents are crafted to make cultural context central to the task. The intents should demonstrate how even explicit localization might sometimes result in an incomplete or culturally unfaithful response. Ensure the geographic localization is not the sole definition of culture.\n",

            "content": "The saying \"Charity begins at home, but should not end there\" suggests that our responsibilities and acts of kindness start with our immediate family and close circle but should ideally extend to the broader community and beyond. This reflects an understanding of generosity as a multi-layered responsibility that involves nurturing and supporting those closest to us while also recognizing and addressing the needs of others in our wider community.\n\nStarting with family and close friends is essential because a strong, supportive foundation often enables individuals to be more effective and empathetic contributors to society. It acknowledges that fulfilling immediate responsibilities and ensuring the well-being of those closest to us creates an environment in which we can grow the capacity to support others.\n\nExtending charity beyond the home implies that our sense of compassion and responsibility should not be limited to our personal sphere. Engaging in community service, charitable activities, or simply acts of kindness and empathy towards strangers reflects a holistic approach to charity. It recognizes the interconnectedness of society and the importance of contributing to the welfare of all, not just those within our personal sphere.\n\nIn terms of one's role in the community, this saying encourages individuals to be both attentive to their personal responsibilities and active participants in creating a more compassionate and equitable society. It highlights the importance of balancing personal obligations with a broader social conscience, urging people to contribute positively at multiple levels, from their immediate environment to society at large."
